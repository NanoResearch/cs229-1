Carroll, Lewis, Lo, Poole, and Rosenthal, 'Measuring Bias and Uncertainty in DW-NOMINATE. Ideal Point Estimates via the Parametric Bootstrap'

DW-NOMINATE is based on normally distributed errors rather than logit errors, which were originally used due to computrational limitations in the 1980s.

Can be used to analyze any body that meets in a series of legislative terms over time.

Scales the legislators and roll call midpoints to be in the unit hypersphere.

"In their original D-NOMINATE work on the U.S. House and Senate, Poole and Rosenthal (1991; 1997; 2001; 2007) found that the linear model in two dimensions was the best combination of explanatory power and parsimony."

Ideal point estimated along two dimensions. "Previous research has demonstrated that the first dimension locations reveal standard left-right or economic cleavages, while the second dimension locations reflect social and sectional divisions."

Ideal points reporesent an individual's most preferred outcome.The ideal point for an individual maximizes the utility function, which is normally distributed. 

NOMINATE clusters together ideologically similar legislators, based on the degree of agreement between their roll call voting records.

By contrast to NOMINATE scores, DW-NOMINATE scores may be used to directly comparse members of difference Congresses across time.

"Political blogger Nate Silver regularly uses DW-NOMINATE scores to gauge the ideological location of major political figures and institutions."
