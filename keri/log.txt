to do (w Joe): 
1. curate data
2. enumerate possible features
3. determine which features will be used in model

maybe do:
1. look at distribution of DW-Nominate scores as a function of candidate and party across time

dicussion on the limitations and uses of PCA:
http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/350/lectures/13/lecture-{10,13}.pdf

interesting points:
  PCA guarantees that the first q components will do a better (mean-square) job of reconstructing the original data than any
other linear method using only q components.
 the component scores give the optimal linear multidimensional scaling
 PCA is purely a descriptive technique; in itself it makes no prediction about
what future data will look like.

PCs are the eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix, V
V = (1/n)*X^T*X
converges to V_0 (true convariance matrix) as n->\inf

minimize projection residuals
maximize sample mean <w,x>^2 via some lagrange multiplier shyt

pc heat maps, should have basins

matrix of vote correlations?

example of application:
Gene-expression profiles to predict distant metastasis of lymph-node-negative primary breast cancer
analysis of gene expression for cancerous patterns

TO DO
you: look at finance data and see what we can assemble in terms of features/the code necessary to do that
me: figure out DW-nominate and identifying peeps we want to look at specifically 
and then we'd interface the two and throw it into a PCA routine?

figure out how to call one of the apis in order to query vote outcome and financial sources

using opensecretsapi:
git clone git@github.com:opensecrets/python-crpapi.git

objective: given candidate, return vector of normalized financial contributions 


to figure out:
time.  which yr?
normalizing vector elements
pca on matrix - does it have to be square?
